Description:
A web application that displays a map with markers pinned to user inputted locations.
When a pinned marker is clicked, it displays an infoWindow with the name of the location 
and any photos that the user had added to that location's collection.
Also on the page is a search bar and search location button which allows users to search
for a location using the name of the location and then pressing the search button.
Under the search bar is a file chooser which allows users to add photos to the last searched
location's collection by browsing and choosing files one at a time.
At the bottom is a submit button which pushes all of the inputted info into the Firebase Database.
To see the collection, the user must refresh the map page.
